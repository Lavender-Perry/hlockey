# Hlockey
Hlockey library and console application.

## Installation Instructions
1. Get Ruby if you do not already have it ([instructions](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/))
2. In the terminal/command prompt, run `gem install hlockey` if this is your first season you installed. Otherwise, run `gem update hlockey`.
3. Start the program by running `hlockey` in the terminal/command prompt.

## Other uses
If you want to modify the code, you can download it from releases or clone it directly.\
If you do, you can run it (if you have Ruby installed) with `gem build hlockey.gemspec`, `gem install hlockey-{version}.gem`, `hlockey`.\
However, this will override your installed version of Hlockey.\
To get normal Hlockey back, run `gem uninstall hlockey` then `gem install hlockey`.\
\
Hlockey can be used as a dependency for your own projects.\
Documentation for this will be available eventually.
